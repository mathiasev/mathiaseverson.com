Here's what I use for my day-to-day development.

Programs and Tooling
--------------------

These are the programs that I’m using day-to-day

#### VS Code

Developer friendly, popular – and the integrated terminal and Git management help to streamline processes.

#### Windows 10 + WSL

Within the corporate Windows environment, most things are possible – however, I’ll jump into Ubuntu or a Docker container when needed.

#### Git, NPM

Keeping track of code and developing across devices is made easy with Git. NPM’s where I’m getting my JS packages from.

Languages and Frameworks
------------------------

The Gutenberg editor uses blocks to create all types of content, replacing a half-dozen ways of customizing WordPress.

### WordPress

WordPress has come along way from it’s blogging platform days – and it’s a great base for all users to manage their content.

By developing Gutenberg blocks and using custom themes we’re not missing out on the latest performance opportunities.

### Vue

Vue provides a straight-forward front-end layer to make the magic happen.

Templating components that work with WP backend is a breeze.

### Laravel

When a more custom solution is required, Laravel provides the structure and foundations for building custom apps.

### Tailwind

Taking the hassle out of CSS, Tailwind provides the perfect utility to implement custom styling without introducing whole frameworks.
